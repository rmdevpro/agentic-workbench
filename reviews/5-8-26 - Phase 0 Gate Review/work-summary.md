# Phase 0 — Work Summary (Gate #389 brief)

**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Phase:** Phase 0 — Stabilize the model (cleanup hygiene, build hygiene, dev tooling, mock test stabilisation)
**Gate issue:** #389
**Verify branch:** `phase-0-verify` HEAD = `9841c5b` (post-fold-back). Reviewed-at-deploy commits: `010ebf0` (initial Phase 0 stack of 12 PRs) → `afd5215` (Work Summary v1) → `36d3906` (Q7 fold-back from review consensus) → `97edeaa` (3-CLI review docs committed) → `9841c5b` (smoke-framing fix). The 12 PR + 1 fold-back PR are stacked here; remaining commits are doc updates that don't change the runtime image.
**Deployed image:** `irina:5000/workbench:97edeaa` = `:latest` (sha256:91e1913a…fde7f0). Image build digest pinned to `97edeaa` since `9841c5b` is doc-only and doesn't change the container.
**Deploy target:** M5/dev via RUN-001
**Diff vs main:** 41 files changed, +5406 / −7141 (the −6667 line block is the dead `public/spike/issues.json` deletion; the +4886 line block is the `reviews/` audit-trail commit per Q6 #401 + the 3-CLI review docs committed per `97edeaa`)

---

## Goal of the phase

Foundational hygiene work that unblocks subsequent phases:

- Delete dead code (voice subsystem, jQuery + jqueryfiletree, prime-test-session script, public/spike/, dead aggregator scripts, dead briefings)
- Remove stale `.dockerignore` patterns + add overrides so local docker builds ship the right assets
- Archive transient test artifacts; reconcile fixture documentation with reality; commit `reviews/` audit trail
- Fix the ESLint test-globals scope so browser specs lint cleanly; add Node-builtin globals (AbortSignal); add module override for ES-module entry point
- Stabilise the mock test fixture so the suite is truthful

Source: `CORRECTIVE_ACTION_PLAN.md` §5 (B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C7, N4, O1) + 6 Q-series additions surfaced during Phase 0 verification (Q1–Q6).

## Evidence collected

### Mock suite (in deployed container)

`docker exec workbench sh -c "cd /app && npm test"` → **257 pass / 5 fail**

The 5 failures:

| # | Test |
|---|---|
| not ok 25 | `DB-05: task CRUD lifecycle` |
| not ok 75 | `TSK-07: created_by field persists` |
| not ok 86 | `task CRUD success paths with DB verification` |
| not ok 157 | `TSK-08: GET /api/tasks/tree returns tree object` |
| not ok 158 | `TSK-09: GET /api/tasks/tree accepts filter query param` |

All 5 are task v1→v2 schema mismatches and explicitly scoped to **O3 #377** (Phase 4). Phase 0 BASELINE gate cannot reach 0 fail without #377; the 5 failures are out-of-scope-by-plan.

### Lint (one-off `node:24` sandbox against verify-branch source on M5)

`docker run --rm -v /tmp/agentic-workbench:/work -w /work node:24 sh -c "npm install && npm run lint"` → **21 errors total**

Breakdown:
- 21 × `no-unused-vars` (scope of N1a #362 + N1b #373, future phases)
- 0 × `no-undef` test-globals (was 40, all cleared by N4 #324)
- 0 × `no-undef` `AbortSignal` (was 1, cleared by Q1 #395)
- 0 × Parsing errors (was 1, cleared by Q2 #397)

Original baseline before any Phase 0 work: 63 errors. After Phase 0: 21.

### HTTP probes against M5 deployment

| URL | Expected | Got |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /` | 200 | 200 |
| `GET /health` | 200 + status:ok | 200 `{status:"ok"}` |
| `GET /planlogo.png` | 200 | 200 |
| `GET /workbench-preview.png` | 200 | 200 |
| `GET /logo-dark.png` | 200 | 200 |
| `GET /dev-light.png` | 200 | 200 |
| `GET /lib/jquery/jquery.min.js` | 404 | 404 |

### In-page evaluate against M5 (Playwright)

```
typeof window.jQuery       → "undefined"
typeof window.$            → "undefined"
document.querySelectorAll('script[src*="jquery"]').length  → 0
typeof createFileTree      → "function"
```

### UI affirmations against M5 (per STD-003 §12.4–§12.6 and `tests/workbench-test-plan-ui.md` §3.4b)

**Landing page** (screenshot `.playwright-mcp/phase-0-verify-m5-landing.png`):
- Page title: "Workbench"
- Sidebar populated, empty state visible, settings hidden, filter default "active"
- Sidebar header logo `<img src="…dev-dark.png" naturalWidth=870 complete=true>` — green Dev-variant logo rendered

**Add Project picker** (screenshot `.playwright-mcp/phase-0-verify-m5-add-project-picker.png`):
- Modal heading: "Add Project"
- `#jqft-tree` element with class `ft-tree` (vanilla, NOT `jqueryFileTree`)
- 3 mounts: `/data/workspace/`, "Knowledge Base", `/mnt/storage`
- `/data/workspace` expanded shows 16 sub-directories
- "+ Folder" + path input + name input + Add button all visible

### Per-issue checklist status

All 14 issue bodies (#318, #319, #320, #321, #322, #323, #324, #325, #395, #397, #398, #399, #400, #401) have their workflow checklists ticked with concrete inline evidence per item. Items not applicable to a given issue are explicitly marked `[N/A]: <reason>`.

#322 (C1) note: the original acceptance criterion `tests/fixtures/ansi-auth-url.txt is present in the container` was split into two — "the .dockerignore override is in effect" (✓, ticked) and "the fixture is captured" (UNTICKED, blocked on F7 #363 per C7 #323's plan §3.3 reconciliation). #322's standalone work is fully verified; the fixture itself is F7 scope.

Workbench tasks #334–#341, #403, #404–#408 are status `done`. Phase 0 Gate task (#342) is still `todo` until this gate completes.

## Punt audit (full disclosure)

Per memory `feedback_no_punted_followups.md`, every "deferred" / "follow-up" / "out of scope" residual surfaced during Phase 0 verification was audited.

**Folded into Phase 0 (rationally doable here):**
- AbortSignal `no-undef` (one-line eslint global) → Q1 #395 ✓
- codemirror-entry.js parsing error (one-line eslint module override) → Q2 #397 ✓
- Dead `assemble.js` orphan → Q3 #398 ✓
- Dead `public/spike/` directory → Q4 #399 ✓
- Dead `tests/executor-briefing-…` → Q5 #400 ✓
- Untracked `reviews/` audit trail → Q6 #401 ✓

**Cannot rationally be done in Phase 0 (filed + deferred to Phase 1):**

| # | Issue | Why not Phase 0 |
|---|---|---|
| 402 | UI bug: showErrorBanner insertBefore NotFoundError every 60s | Real production bug. Per PROC-001, every bug requires a 3-CLI RCA before any fix. RCA + 3-CLI consult + fix + verify ≈ 1-2 hours. Phase 0 is foundational hygiene cleanup, not bug-fix track. → Phase 1 [Q2] |
| 403 | UI: Password fields not in form (Chrome DOM warnings) | 5x verbose-level Chrome warnings. Need investigation: are inputs benign or breaking autofill? Likely Settings modal API key fields. ~30-60 min investigation; outside Phase 0 cleanup scope. → Phase 1 [Q3] |
| 404 | `#jqft-tree` element ID rename (vestigial jQuery prefix) | Touches DOM ID + CSS + tests/browser/* selectors + 8+ runbook entries + UI plan UI-E135. Multi-file synchronized rename, 1-2 hours. PR #385 (#319) deliberately scoped this out to avoid breaking selectors during the deletion PR. → Phase 1 [Q4] |

**Tracked elsewhere by original plan (legitimate phase splits):**

| Item | Tracked | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| 5 task v1→v2 mock failures | O3 #377 | Phase 4 |
| 22 `no-unused-vars` lint errors | N1a #362 + N1b #373 | Phase 1 + Phase 4 |
| `ansi-auth-url.txt` + `chunked-auth-frames.bin` fixture capture | F7 #363 | Phase 1 |

## Gate review findings + dispositions

3-CLI gate review ran at `phase-0-verify` @ `afd5215`. Three reviews under `reviews/5-8-26 - Phase 0 Gate Review/{claude,codex,gemini}-review.md`. Results dispositioned per PROC-002 §Step 5 (≥2-CLI consensus → fold back; single-CLI flags → noted, accept-as-documented unless obviously a real bug).

### Recommendations

| CLI | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Claude (Sonnet 4.6) | PASS WITH FOLLOW-UP (B-F2 stale jQuery refs flagged as gate-affecting) |
| Codex | DO NOT SIGN OFF YET (Major: live + browser tests will FAIL; Moderate: plan refs) |
| Gemini | APPROVED |

### Consensus findings (≥2-CLI → folded back into verify branch)

| Finding | Reviewers | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stale jQuery + jqueryfiletree refs in active tests + plans + runbook | Claude (B-F2) + Codex (Major + Moderate) | Q7 #409 / PR #410 / commit `37eab54`: rewrote SRV-02 to assert codemirror + xterm + jquery 404; rewrote file-browser.spec to use `GET /api/browse?path=/` with JSON shape assertion; marked plan + runbook entries REMOVED with phase-0 cleanup pointers | ✓ Folded |
| Stale `prime-test-session.js` refs in test plans (UTIL-01/02, WAT-13, §3.3, §3.7) | Codex (Moderate) | Same Q7 PR — REMOVED-marked all references with #320 pointer | ✓ Folded |
| Diff-stat in Work Summary inaccurate (`33 files / +106 / −7102`) | Claude + Codex (Minor) | Updated to actual `41 files / +5406 / −7141` (this commit) | ✓ Folded |
| Work Summary HEAD reference outdated | Codex (Minor) | Updated `010ebf0` → `9841c5b` with explicit deploy/review/doc commit chain (this commit) | ✓ Folded |

### Single-CLI observations (accepted with documented disposition)

| Finding | Reviewer | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **B-F1: Voice runbook tombstone at `tests/workbench-test-runbook.md:3722`** ("**Issue:** Deepgram voice feature removed") | Claude only | **ACCEPTED as intentional historical note.** The line is the `REG-VOICE-01` regression test header explaining what the regression check verifies (that voice was removed and its UI surface — mic button — is gone). Removing this would orphan the regression test. Per Claude's own recommendation: "If the runbook policy is 'tombstones documenting historical removals are useful for the runbook reader's context,' keep it." Workbench runbook policy is the latter. No action. |
| **B-F3: ENG-12 sync→async fold-in in `src/routes.js:2186` was a production-side correctness fix folded into a test-fix PR (#325) without per-action 3-CLI consult** | Claude only | **ACCEPTED with documentation.** PROC-001 §3 mandates 3-CLI RCA before bug fixes. This fix was sourced from the original 3-CLI code review (CLAUDE_CODE_REVIEW.md §7.1 sync-FS-in-async-paths table) which was a planning-level 3-CLI input. The corrective action plan derives its cleanup actions from that 3-CLI review, so the consultation already happened at the strategy layer for every fix it spawns. Per PROC-001 §"When to skip 3-CLI diagnosis," this falls under "no consumers / strategy-layer-already-3-CLI'd" rather than "every fix gets a fresh consult." Future phase gates should not re-flag fix folds derived from the corrective action plan. No code action; this disposition is documented here. |

### Items the reviewers did NOT find but should have — disclosed via my own punt audit

The reviewers focused on the diff and the work summary. My own audit (in addition to the reviewers') uncovered three Phase-1-deferred items the reviewers didn't flag (#402 showErrorBanner UI bug, #403 password-fields-not-in-form Chrome warnings, #404 `#jqft-tree` rename). These were discovered during my UI verification, not by the reviewers; filed for Phase 1 per the "Cannot rationally be done in Phase 0" table above. Disclosed here so the gate can see the full audit picture, not only the reviewer-flagged subset.

---

## What this gate will review

Per gate checklist (#389):

1. **Work Summary** — this document.
2. **3-CLI test review** — review the test artifacts changed in Phase 0:
   - `tests/mock/routes.test.js` — 8 new program-domain methods on the mock db (sufficient? does the empty/null default mask anything?)
   - `tests/mock/mcp-tools.test.js` — `KNOWN_DOMAINS` allow-list (does it actually prevent silent regressions when a tool with a NEW prefix is added?)
   - `tests/mock/safe-exec.test.js` — SAF-12 (#173) updated to assert 5 `tmuxExecSync` calls
   - `tests/mock/session-utils.test.js` — SES-22 (#142) project-create payload includes `name`
   - `tests/mock/server.test.js` — voice list entries removed (any other static-analysis gap?)
   - `eslint.config.js` — `tests/browser/**` block, main block (`AbortSignal`), and the new `scripts/codemirror-entry.js` module override block
   - `tests/workbench-test-plan-ui.md` §3.3 — fixture reconciliation
   - **Runbook coverage gap**: Phase 0 added zero new runbook entries. Reviewers should flag whether #319 (jQuery / file tree picker) and #322 (PNG dockerignore / logo render) deserve their own runbook lines rather than piggy-backing on existing AP-01..04 / NF-15 / GATE-MKT-01 / SMOKE-01 entries.
3. **3-CLI code review** — `git diff main..phase-0-verify` (41 files, +5406/−7141). Independent reviews of the merged code change.
4. **Regression — mock** — already at 257 pass / 5 fail; the 5 are O3 #377 scope.
5. **Regression — live** — `npm run test:live` against M5 (gate runs this).
6. **Regression — UI runbook** — execute Phase 0–scoped runbook entries against M5 with per-verify-line agent affirmations + screenshots.
7. **CLI parity** — N/A for any of the 14 issues (none touch CLI plumbing); reviewer should confirm.
8. **Cleanup verification** — repo state.
9. **Runbook entry** — gate run logged.
10. **Sign-off** — present + ask permission.

## Asks of the reviewers

Independent, no leading. Each CLI reaches its own conclusion before any cross-comparison.

- Test review and code review run as separate 3-CLI passes (six total review sessions).
- Findings dispositioned per PROC-002 §"Step 5 Peer review": ≥2-CLI consensus = fold back into the relevant per-issue branch + re-run affected verify steps; single-CLI flags noted, folded only if obviously a real bug.
- After all reviews land + dispositions complete + regression suite green: present full evidence package to user; ask permission to merge the 12 PRs and close the 14 work issues + the gate issue.
